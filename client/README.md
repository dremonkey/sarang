Particle Angular Seed
=====================

This is a simple Angular seed for my client side needs. Grunt tasks handle code validation. This is to be used as a git sub-module in my other applications, not as a standalone app.

## Things to Remember
- All image src links in html and tpl.html files should be treated as relative to the top level dir. This ensures that usemin can correctly replace the non-minified version of the image with the minified version.
